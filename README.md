## Coffee-Sales-Shop-Analysis

### Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from a fictional coffee shop to uncover actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, product bundling, and customer targeting. The goal was to explore customer behavior, identify sales trends, and use data to suggest real-world business improvements.

### Dataset Summary
The dataset includes:
- Orders: Transaction-level sales data with customer IDs, dates, products, quantity, and total price
- Customers: Customer details (name, email, country)
- Products: Product names and prices

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, and charts
- Excel Functions: VLOOKUP, IF, IFERROR
- Data Visualization: Bar charts for AOV and sales

### Key Questions Explored
To extract meaningful insights, I focused on the following questions:

1. What is the Average Order Value (AOV) by Country?
2. Total Sales by Time?
3. Which products generate the most revenue?

### Methodology
#### 1. Data Cleaning & Integration
- Used VLOOKUP to pull customer names and emails into the orders table
- Replaced missing email values with blanks for cleaner reporting
- Added a Total Sales column (Quantity Ã— Unit Price) for order-level revenue
#### 2. Pivot Table Analysis
- Built pivot tables to:
- Count orders per country
- Sum total revenue per country
- Calculate Average Order Value (AOV) by dividing total sales by order count
#### 3. Data Visualization
- Created bar charts in Excel to visually compare:
- AOV by Country
- Top-Selling Products

### Key Insights
#### 1. Average Order Value (AOV) by Country
Country Orders Total Sales AOV (USD) United States 774 $35,639-$46.04 United Kingdom 73 $2,799-$38.35 Ireland 153 $6,697-$43.77

Insight: Customers in the USA and Ireland tend to spend between $43â€“$46 per order, while the UK is slightly lower.

#### 2. High-Value Customers
Identified customers with the most orders and highest total spend
Insight: A small group of repeat customers drives a large portion of revenue

#### 3. Top-Selling Products
Highest-grossing items were premium coffee and merchandise
Strong cross-sell potential with mugs, snacks, and bundled items

### Business Recommendations
#### 1. Introduce Regional Bundle Offers

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Similar bundle around $44 for Irish market
ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Lower bundle offer (~$38) for UK to match their AOV

#### 2. Targeted Email Campaigns
Use customer email data to send promotions to top buyers
Offer loyalty rewards for frequent customers to increase retention

#### 3. Feature Top Products in Campaigns
Highlight premium coffee products and best-sellers in ads
Encourage bundling with related merchandise

### Final Summary
This project showcases how simple Excel tools, when combined with strong business thinking, can turn raw data into actionable insights. It reflects a real-world scenario where analytics directly shape marketing, sales strategy, and customer engagement.
